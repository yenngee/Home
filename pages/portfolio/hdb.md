### Introduction
How much does a flat actually cost within the area? Is the government overpricing the flat? What factors contribute to the prices of HDBs and resale? Would the price of the flat I own rise in the future?

These are the questions that have been running through my head even before embarking on this project and these questions are common for any Singaporean looking to get a house. Through analyzing the resale and BTO (built-to-order) data found from data.gov.sg. i hope that I am able to 

In this project I will be going through the following: 
A) Background Information on the problem 
B) Dataset that I have used 
C) Approaches and Processes to the Problem 
D) EDA and insights 
E) Modelling 
   i) Regression on the 'variance' 
   ii) Time Series Analysis on the 'mean' 
F) Evaluation and Limitations 
G) Production 

## A) Background information 

HDB stands for Housing Development Board, and it is a government board that is in charge of public housing in Singapore
