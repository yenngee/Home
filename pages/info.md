## Who am I.... 

24601 (no I'm just kidding, kudos to those who got the reference!) 

I am an aspiring data analyst, who recently completed a data science course at General Assembly. I graduated National University of Singapore With Bachelor of Science, majoring in Applied Mathematics and minor in Economics. I started dancing since I was four and have been involved in the Performing Arts ever since. With my unlikely background in I am looking forward to combining my experience with my newfound skills to help businesses make educated decisions through analysing data. 

## Why Data Science? 
Strangely enough, it started with my love for the Arts, which motivated me to take up the role of an Arts Administrator at NUS Centre For the Arts. During the 2.5 years of organizing Arts events, there were common problems we faced such as pricing of tickets and promoting our events to increase the attendance of these events. Information was collected through surveys but we barely scraped the surface of the data when using it. It was then that I felt that better decisions could be made if we were to analyze our information more thoroughly and that started my interest in Data Analysis. 

I decided to go through an intensive period of studying Data Science in a Data Science Immersive Course at General Assembly. During these three months, I learnt a broad range of tools and skills to analyze data and solve problems systematically. Data Science is a learning process. I am perfectly aware it was not possible to learn every single tool and technique in detail let alone in 3 months. However, this course provided a sound foundation and I have learnt the possibilities and how to learn to explore such possibilities.
...and learn at the same time.

## When I'm not Data Sciencing: 
- Complete Udemy courses that I have bought 
- Dance 
- Drink tea (I'm a tea snob.) 
- Head for data related talks 


## What's next? 
I am currently seeking for career opportunities in data science related positions as well. If you are keen for a discussion, I can be contacted via LinkedIn or the [‘Contact Me’][1] page.
