The awesome part about Jupyter Notebook is that it can keep notes and code within the same document which explains things very clearly. What I really like about this is that you are also able to add a navigation bar, something like a content page at the side similar to what you have in a PDF file. 
I tried seraching 


Command prompt


pip install autopep8
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions 
pip install jupyter_nbextensions_configurator 
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user 
jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable 

Kudos to my ex-classmate Brian, who is terribly good at formatting and cannot stand untidy documents. :)
